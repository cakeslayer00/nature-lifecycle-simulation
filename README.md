# nature-lifecycle-simulation

Natural cycle of things, predators consume carnivores, carnivores consume grass and stuff. Sole purpose is to build application based on OOP and SOLID principles. Used BFS algorithm for search.

# How to run

1. Simply clone repository using `git clone https://github.com/cakeslayer00/nature-lifecycle-simulation`
2. Enter directory `cd nature-lifecycle-simulation`
3. Assuming you have maven and java installed in your system, use `mvn clean package` followed with `java -cp target/simulation-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Dsun.stdout.encoding=UTF-8 -Dsun.stderr.encoding=UTF-8 -Dconsole.encoding=UTF-8 dev.sv.Main` (though i think it won't work as anticipated, because encoding issues, so better run using Intelij)
4. Enjoy!
